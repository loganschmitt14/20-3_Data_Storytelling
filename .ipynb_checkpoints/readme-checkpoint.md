# PGA Tour Narrative Project

=============================

The aim of this project is to understand the validity of the old claim "drive for show, putt for dough."

The saying implies that hitting long drives is not what ends up mattering for a player's score, and that putting makes the difference.

I want to understand if that really is the case. I believe that if the saying holds true, the best players on Tour will be the best putters,
and that there won't be a strong correlation between driving distance and success.
